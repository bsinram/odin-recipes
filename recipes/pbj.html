    <h2>Grilled Peanutbutter and Jelly Sandwich</h2>
    <p>This may be the best PB&J I can find.</p>
    <p>The warmth and crunch of the toasted bread combined with the sweet, savory, and salty combination of creamy, fat reduced Jif PB and jelly is amazing</p>
    <p>I could have one of these <em>every single day</em> of my life!</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons butter (optional, I don't like butter)</li>
        <li>2 slices white bread <i>(or any bread that you want)</i></li>
        <li>2 teaspoons of any flavor fruit jelly</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon peanut butter <i>(or more if you want to enjoy yourself :))</i></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a griddle or skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Spread butter on one side of each slice of bread. Spread jelly on the unbuttered side of one slice of bread; spread peanut butter on the other unbuttered side. Place bread slices together, so peanut butter and jelly are in the middle.</li>
            <li>Cook on the preheated griddle until golden brown and heated through, about 4 minutes per side.</li>
        </ol>
