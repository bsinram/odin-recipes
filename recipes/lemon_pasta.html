        <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, or more as needed</li>
        <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste</li>
        <li>2.5 cups milk</li>
        <li>3 cubes chicken bouillon</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup cold water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>1/2 pound seasoned grilled chicken chunks</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package linguine pasta</li>
        <li>1/4 cup lemon juice</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon zest</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat butter and olive oil together in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir onion and garlic until tender but not browned, about 5 minutes. Add milk, bouillon, oregano, salt, and pepper to onion mixture; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and cook sauce for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Whisk cold water and cornstarch together in a bowl until smooth. Mix cornstarch mixture and chicken into sauce; cook until heated through and thickened, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain.</li>
            <li>Turn heat under saucepan with sauce to low; add lemon juice, parsley, and lemon zest and cook until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Add pasta, toss to coat, and transfer to a serving bowl; top with Parmesan cheese.</li>
